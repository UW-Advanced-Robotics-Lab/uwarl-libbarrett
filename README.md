# Libbarrett 2.0.0
> Libbarrett is a real-time controls library written in C++ that runs Barrett
Technology products (WAM and BarrettHand)

### Configuration Files for the WAM
Upon installation of libbarrett, the configuration files of the robot are installed to the `/etc/barrett` directory. However, to give an additional flexibility of each user maintaining their own configurations for the same robot, by default, the configuration files are read from `~/.barrett` directory if it exists. If not, then libbarrett reads the necessary configuration files from `/etc/barrett/` directory. It is up to the user to maintain and populate the `~/.barrett` directory.

### Eclipse IDE setup
It is possible to use CMake to generate several output formats, including Eclipse CDT4 project files. For details, see:
    http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Eclipse_CDT4_Generator
To generate Eclipse project files, run:
```
cmake . -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"
```
Then import the generated project into your Eclipse workspace using:
File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace
